/**
 * 4-3. [3] Take a sequence of 2n real numbers as input. Design an O(n log n) algorithm that
 * partitions the numbers into n pairs, with the property that the partition minimizes
 * the maximum sum of a pair. For example, say we are given the numbers (1,3,5,9).
 * The possible partitions are ((1,3),(5,9)), ((1,5),(3,9)), and ((1,9),(3,5)). The pair
 * sums for these partitions are (4,14), (6,12), and (10,8). Thus the third partition has
 * 10 as its maximum sum, which is the minimum over the three partitions.
 * 
 * we need to pair up smallest with largest numbers. and so on to get the results
