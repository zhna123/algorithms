 * 4-5. [3] The mode of a set of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently in the
 * set. The set (4, 6, 2, 4, 3, 1) has a mode of 4. Give an efficient and correct algorithm
 * to compute the mode of a set of n numbers.
 * 
 * 1. sort the numbers
 * 2. use a counter to record the current most frequent number
 * 
 * we can also use a map to store number as the key; frequency as the value
 * then scan the map. This way we got run time 2n. (O(n))
