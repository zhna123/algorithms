/**
 * 4-4. [3] Assume that we are given n pairs of items as input, where the first item is a
 * number and the second item is one of three colors (red, blue, or yellow). Further
 * assume that the items are sorted by number. Give an O(n) algorithm to sort the
 * items by color (all reds before all blues before all yellows) such that the numbers
 * for identical colors stay sorted.
 * For example: (1,blue), (3,red), (4,blue), (6,yellow), (9,red) should become (3,red),
 * (9,red), (1,blue), (4,blue), (6,yellow).
 * 
 * To solve:
 * use bucket sort
