/**
 * 3-15. [8] Design a data structure that allows one to search, insert, and delete an integer
 * X in O(1) time (i.e. , constant time, independent of the total number of integers
 * stored). Assume that 1 ≤ X ≤ n and that there are m+n units of space available,
 * where m is the maximum number of integers that can be in the table at any one
 * time. (Hint: use two arrays A[1..n] and B[1..m].) You are not allowed to initialize
 * either A or B, as that would take O(m) or O(n) operations. This means the arrays
 * are full of random garbage to begin with, so you must be very careful.
