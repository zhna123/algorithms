/**
 * 3-14. [8] Extend the data structure of the previous problem to support insertions and
 * deletions. Each element now has both a key and a value. An element is accessed
 * by its key. The addition operation is applied to the values, but the elements are
 * accessed by its key. The Partial sum operation is different.
 * • Add(k,y) – Add the value y to the item with key k.
 * • Insert(k,y) – Insert a new item with key k and value y.
 * • Delete(k) – Delete the item with key k.
 * • Partial-sum(k) – Return the sum of all the elements currently in the set whose
 * key is less than y
 * The worst case running time should still be O(n log n) for any sequence of O(n)
 * operations.
