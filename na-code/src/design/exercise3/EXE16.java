/**
 * 3-16. [5] Implement versions of several different dictionary data structures, such as linked
 * lists, binary trees, balanced binary search trees, and hash tables. Conduct experiments
 * to assess the relative performance of these data structures in a simple application
 * that reads a large text file and reports exactly one instance of each word
 * that appears within it. This application can be efficiently implemented by maintaining
 * a dictionary of all distinct words that have appeared thus far in the text
 * and inserting/reporting each word that is not found. Write a brief report with your
 * conclusions.

 * normal singly linked list can't use a binary search (traversal will take O(n) time)
