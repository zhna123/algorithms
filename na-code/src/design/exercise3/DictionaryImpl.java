 * design a dictionary with an array(unsorted) with size n.
 * --- search A[i] can be done in O(1)
 * --- insertion can be done in O(1) A[i]=value
 * --- deletion: first way is to insert a null to the deleted valueA[i], which will take O(1)
 * second way is to replace A[i] with A[n], then decrease n by 1 (length)
